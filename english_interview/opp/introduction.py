Introduction:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Is a programming paradigm that is centered around the concept of objects.
    In Python, OOP allows you to structure your code using classes and objects, which make it easier to organize, reuse,
    and scale your code. OOP helps to group data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together, which can be more
    intuitive when dealing with real-world scenarios like modeling a bank account, a student, or a car.

The fundamental principles of OOP include:
    1. Classes and Objects:
        A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of that class.
        Objects have attributes (data) and methods (behavior).

    2. Inheritance:
        Inheritance allows new classes to be based on existing classes, inheriting and reusing their attributes
        and methods. This promotes code reuse and helps in creating hierarchical relationships between classes.

    3. Encapsulation:
        Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the implementation details of an object's internal state and providing
        a well-defined interface for interacting with the object.

    4. Polymorphism:
        Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass,
        enabling code to work with objects of different types without knowing their specific implementation details.

    5. Abstraction:
        Representing essential features and hiding unnecessary details to simplify the complexity
