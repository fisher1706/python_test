To install software on macOS, you can use several methods depending on your preferences and the type of software.
Below are the most common methods:

1. Mac App Store
Open the App Store from your Dock or via Spotlight.
Search for the application you want to install.
Click Get or the price (if it's paid), then Install.

2. DMG Files (Disk Image Files)
Download the .dmg file from the software's official website.
Open the .dmg file.
Drag the application icon to the Applications folder.
Eject the .dmg file after installation.

3. Homebrew (Package Manager for macOS)
If you prefer using the terminal, Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies the installation
of open-source software.

Install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

nce Homebrew is installed, you can install software by running:
brew install <software-name>

4. MacPorts (Another Package Manager)
Similar to Homebrew, MacPorts is another package manager.

Install MacPorts from the official site.
Install software with the following command:
sudo port install <software-name>

5. Manual Installation via ZIP Files
Download the ZIP file for the software.
Extract it, and move the application to the Applications folder.
Each method serves different needs, with Homebrew being highly favored for developers due to its ease
of use in managing dependencies.
